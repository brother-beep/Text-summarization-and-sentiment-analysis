# Text-summarization-and-sentiment-analysis
This Project is based on Natural Language Processing(NLP).After creating the model I have deployed it into a web application using streamlit module. There are two types of summarization one is 
extractive summarization and the other one is abstractive summarization . I made this summarizer based on extractive method. 
For summarize the text we have used natural language toolkit(nltk module). For sentiment analysis we have Textblob.To work with document like pdf,html,xml we have used PyPDF2 module. 

At first, we tokenized the text into sentences and words and got a list of words . Then removed stopwords and other symbols from the words list. Then we give the sentences ranking and words into frequency.
